CS132 Spring 2017 Security Lab

## Phase 2: Configuration
This part is very important, and you should do this portion of the lab carefully to ensure that your server will be running smoothly (until some other group attacks it of course!). 

In particular, there are two files that you'll want to configure: _config.js_ and _./db/create.sql_. At this point, however, if you have not yet received an email from us about your _username_, _password_, _database_, and _port #_, then you should **stop** and make sure you've obtained these credentials.
